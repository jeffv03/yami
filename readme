YAMI - YET ANOTHER MOUSE INTERFACE
==================================

YAMI is a mouse interface that enables serial PC mice to be used on AMIGA
or ATARI ST computers.

YAMI is released under GPL v3.

For further information see:  http://yami.shredzone.org


ASSEMBLING THE HARDWARE
=======================

YAMI is easy assembled if you know how to read schematics and use a soldering
iron. You will find the schematic diagram and part list in the "schematics"
directory.

If you use an Atari ST, or if you won't use the mouse wheel on your Amiga,
you can spare the connector named "JOY", which saves you some tedious wiring.

The YAMI hardware does some voltage tricks. Please make sure that you build
the YAMI hardware EXACTLY after the schematics. If you fail to do so, and if
you're lucky you will only damage your mouse and your YAMI hardware. With bad
luck you will also destroy your Amiga or Atari vintage computer, though, so be
extra careful, and check everything at least twice and once again before you
connect YAMI for the first time.

NOTE that YAMI is only designed for serial PC mice. These mice are also very
hard to find nowadays. Some PS/2 mice can be used on a serial line with a PS/2
to serial adapter. If you are using a PS/2 mouse, make sure that your mouse
does actually support such an adapter!

Modern mice only support USB (and maybe PS/2 with an adapter). Sadly, you
cannot use those ones with YAMI. Don't even think about connecting a USB mouse
to a PS/2 adapter, and the PS/2 adapter to a serial adapter. You will most
likely destroy your mouse that way.

NEVER NEVER EVER connect an Amiga or Atari mouse to YAMI. You will brick that
mouse if you do so. Also do not connect Amiga or Atari joysticks to YAMI, and
do not connect other serial devices to YAMI. In other words: ONLY connect a
serial or PS/2 mouse to YAMI.

Actually, a YAMI2 was planned, which was designed to support USB mice. Anyhow
handling USB data traffic requires more sophisticated hardware and software,
and the dying Amiga platform wasn't much promising for an acceptable return
of investments in development time.


FLASHING YAMI INTO THE PIC PROCESSOR
====================================

In the "dumps" directory, you will find hex dumps that are ready for being
flashed into the PIC processor.

yami-p.hex             contains the YAMI firmware.

You also need one of these EEPROM dumps, depending on your requirements:

yami-d-wheel.hex       AMIGA version, with mouse wheel support (use this
                       one if you are in doubt)
yami-d.hex             AMIGA version, without mouse wheel support
yami-d-atari.hex       ATARI version, without mouse wheel support (Atari
                       owners would positively want this one)

Note that there is no EEPROM dump for Atari ST with wheel support. This is
due to hardware limitations. Of the Atari ST, of course. ;-)

If you want to flash your PIC from the source code, make sure to properly
configure the EEPROM with the appropriate AMIGA/ATARI and WHEEL/NO WHEEL
flags.


USING YAMI
==========

Using YAMI is fairly easy.

Connect your serial PC mouse (or a PS/2 mouse with the included serial
adapter) to the SERIAL port of YAMI.

Turn off your Amiga/Atari, then connect YAMI's MOUSE connector to the mouse
port of your computer. Optionally, also plug the JOY connector to the
joystick port of your Amiga.

Now turn on your computer. The PC mouse should work right from the start.
No drivers are required. At least unless you want to use the mouse wheel.

For the mouse wheel, you need to install the "YamiCX" commodity. You can find
the source code in the "yamiCX" directory, and a compiled binary in the
AmiNet.

Anyhow note that the mouse wheel is poorly supported by the Amiga. Only some
MUI applications will actually make use of the mouse wheel.


JOYSTICK MODE
=============

YAMI offers a special joystick mode. To use it, you will need a DB9 Y cable
for each joystick. Connect the Y cable to the joystick port of your computer.
On the one end of the Y cable, you connect the joystick, and on the other
end you connect the appropriate YAMI port. You can also connect a second Y
cable to the mouse port of your computer, in order to connect a second
joystick.

Now, if you want to use the joystick, just press on its fire button. YAMI
will detect that, and will turn off its connector. You can start using the
joystick now, without YAMI interfering.

If you want to use the mouse again, just move it. YAMI will immediately
resume its work.

Please only use simple switched joysticks (like the good old Competition Pro).
Do not use analog joysticks or other funny sticks. They might interfere with
YAMI if you use the mouse, and they might even damage YAMI!


F A Q
=====

? Can I purchase an assembled and ready-to-use YAMI from you?
! Unfortunately not. I have already sold the last stock of YAMI a couple
  of years ago. I don't have any PCBs left, nor do I have the time to
  resume the YAMI production.

? I have no way to flash a PIC processor. Can I purchase a preprogrammed PIC
  processor from you?
! Maybe. It's difficult for me too, because I don't own a professional PIC
  programmer. If you have absolutely no other way to flash the PIC processor,
  please get in contact with me.

? Can I use a USB mouse?
! No, you cannot. YAMI only supports mice with a serial interface.

? Can I use a PS/2 mouse?
! Probably. If there was a PS/2 to Serial adapter included with the mouse,
  you can use the mouse with YAMI.

? I have accidentally connected my Amiga mouse to the YAMI mouse port.
! Bad news: the mouse is most likely dead now.

? I have bought a YAMI interface from you in the good old times. Are there
  updates available?
! If you have received it in November 2000 or later, you already have the
  latest firmware. If you have an earlier model, you can send it in for a
  free update. You only have to cover the costs for shipping. Please get in
  contact with me for further details.


DISCLAIMER
==========

I am myself using my YAMI interface for a decade now. It proved to be very
reliable, and a good companion to my Amiga. There were also a number of YAMI
interfaces sold in the past, and I never received a compaint. So I am very
confident that the design of YAMI is safe.

Anyhow please be aware that this hardware has the potential to damage your
good old vintage computer, especially if you use a fancy mouse, or if you
make a mistake building the hardware or flashing the firmware.

You got the YAMI schematics, source codes and binaries free of charge. It's
a gift, and it's even licensed under GPLv3 now. It's meant as a favor for all
the Amiga and Atari lovers out there.

You use all this information as is, on your own risk and without any
guarantees expressed or implied.

If you are afraid of damaging your computer, please do not assemble the
YAMI hardware.

If you do not exactly know how to read the schematics, purchase the required
components, build the hardware and flash the firmware, please ask someone who
does know.
